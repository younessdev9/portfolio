JavaScript is a living language which means new features get added to the language every year, its constantly evolving this
process is managed by [tc39 committee](https://github.com/tc39), which is a group of delegates, from different large
companies and organizations, that are interested in JavaScript language these delegates meet few times a year to
decide which proposal will be advanced between the 5 stages of consideration, once a proposal reaches stage 4 it is
deemed finished and added to the ECMAScript specification ready to use by JavaScript engines, therefore developers.
ES2015 is the most extensive update to the language since it was first released in 1997. but we can't ignore
the cool feauture that got added to it since then. and in this articel we're going to see the most recent
feauture without further ado let's get to it

## Logical Assignment Operators

Now You can assign a value to a variable based on a logical operation. thanks to the new logical assignment
operators - <HLight>&&=</HLight> , <HLight> ||= </HLight> and <HLight>??=</HLight> -
it is a combination of logical operator with the assignment expression and a great example to understand that
is these operator <HLight>+=</HLight>, <HLight>-=</HLight>, <HLight>\*=</HLight> they work similarly.
now let's take it further and use some examples to get the idea of Logical Assignment Operators

1. And and equals (&&=)

<Code
  code={` let fruit1 = "Banana";
let friut2 = "apple"; 
fruit1 &&= friut2; 
// friut1 is now equal to "apple"
// using the And and equals operator it's like saying 
// if there is the friut1 then asign it to the value of friut2
// in other world it like puting it in an if statment like so:
if (fruit1) {
  fruit1 = friut2
}
`}
/>

<Quote>
  N.B : note that we are using <HLight> let </HLight>keyworld to decalre the
  variable we can not use
  <HLight> const </HLight> keyword here because it is unallowed to reasign values
  to primitve types in JavaScript using the <HLight> const </HLight> keyword
</Quote>

2. Or or equals (||=)

the <HLight> ||= </HLight> operator is kind of the opposite of the <HLight> &&= </HLight> operator, the
diffrence is that the <HLight> ||= </HLight> operator makes the asignment only when the left operand is false let's
see how that works:

let use the same example as the previous one

<Code
  code={` let fruit1 = "Banana";
let friut2 = "apple"; 
fruit1 ||= friut2; 
//the value of friut1 will be "apple" only if the current value of friut1 is a falsy value 
// so for this to wok we have to do something like this 
let fruit1 = "";
let friut2 = "apple"; 
fruit1 ||= friut2; // => this will return "apple" this will work and the fruit1 takes the value of friut2 because the fruit1 is a falsy value
`}
/>

and to simailate this in an if statment it's like:

<Code
  code={` let fruit1 = "Banana";
let friut2 = "apple"; 
if(!fruit1) {
  fruit1 = friut2;
}
`}
/>

3. Question question equals (??=)

the <HLight> ??= </HLight> is kind of special one and to understand it we have to
understand the <HLight> ?? </HLight> operator first which is called **Nullish coalescing operator**
it works simailrly to <HLight> && </HLight> operator but it treats non Nullish/undefined values as truty values
you might be like _what the heck does that mean_ 🙄😆 alright alright!! I'm gonna give you a simple example:

<Code
  code={` const mathsMark = 18; 
mathsMark && console.log("You're good at maths 😀"); 
// => You're good at maths 😀
`}
/>

as you can see in the above example when executing this code it will prints to the
console the message but wait what if the mark is 0 and we want to return that 0 from the expression
there is no way you can do that with <HLight> && </HLight> operator unless you did some works around it because the <HLight> && </HLight> operator will treat
0 as false and that's where the <HLight> ?? </HLight> **Nullish coalescing operator** comes
in handy and this operator return 0 from the bellew expression

<Code
  code={` const mathsMark = 0; 
mathsMark ?? console.log("You're good at maths 😀"); 
// => 0 
`}
/>
this code will print to the console the message only if mathsMark in <HLight>
  {" "}
  null{" "}
</HLight>
or <HLight> undefined </HLight>

now that you know how the <HLight> ?? </HLight>
_Nullish coalescing operator_ works let's get back to <HLight> ??= </HLight> operator and see how this operator
works: so basiclly the asignment is going to work only if the left operand is null or undefined lets see an example:

<Code
  code={`let age = null ; 
let newAge = 22;
age ??= newAge // => 22 this will work and return 22 because age is null 
// the same applies if the value of age is undefined
`}
/>

so it like puting in an if statment like so:

<Code
  code={`let age = null ; 
let newAge = 22;
if (age === null || age === undefined) {
  age = newAge
}
`}
/>

personally, I find the last two operators ||= and ??= the most useful because most of the time you'd have to
assign a value to a variable if it's not yet assigned a value

## String.prototype.replaceAll()

this method is useful when you're trying to replace words or sentences in JavaScript String globaly meaning that
you want to replace all the word in the whole String with a new one and this what <HLight> String.prototype.replace() </HLight>
couldn't do because this method replace only the first word it find in the String which not much useful if we are
trying to replace more than 1 words in a String.

we had to do something like:

<Code
  code={`const message = "Thank you for being awesome we just love awesome people like you"; 
const newMessage = message.replace(/awesome/g, "kind")
`}
/>

we had to use a global regular expression. on that String which can lead to a security vulnerability if we get that value
from user input

now in ES12 we can do just like that using Sring instead of Regex it would look like this:

<Code
  code={`const message = "Thank you for being awesome we just love awesome people like you"; 
const newMessage = message.replaceAll("awesome", "kind")
console.log(newMessage) // Thank you for being kind we just love kind people like you
`}
/>

## Numeric Separators

this new feauture it's just for numbers readability, which is pretty nice feature to have now you can add an underscore
to numbers it doesn't effect the number value or performance by anyhow

<Code
  code={`// the numbers are reprented like so in JavaScript
const bigNumber = 3958937294; 
// thanks to this new feauture now we can separate them by an underscore for readability
const newMessage = 3_958_937_294
// we can also do it on decimals 
const balance = 3_942_840.949_28
`}
/>

<Quote>
  N.B : note that you can use it to separete numbers by 3 or 2 or whatever it
  not reqiured to anly separate numbers by 3 digits
</Quote>

## Promise.any()

this new feauture it’s like a combination between <HLight> Promise.race() </HLight> and <HLight> Promise.allSettled() </HLight>
where we can run a list of promises and it’s going to stop as soon as one of them fulfills but as
supposed to promise.race() which going to fail imidiatly if one of theme rejects it’s going to continue on if one of them fails. if all
of them fails <HLight> Promise.any() </HLight> will return what's called an AggregateError (a new subclass of Error)
which tells us all of the problems that happend with each Promise

<Code
  code={`Promise.any([
  fetch('https://v8.dev/').then(() => 'home'),
  fetch('https://v8.dev/blog').then(() => 'blog'),
]).then((value) => {
  // Any of the promises was fulfilled.
  console.log(value);
}).catch((error) => {
  // in case all of the promises rejected this will return AggregateError
  console.log(error);
});
`}
/>

<Quote>
  N.B : note that if you try to run this code in your browser it will not work
  due to CORS, you can try this in nodejs using node-fetch module
</Quote>

so <HLight> Promise.any() </HLight> is useful when you want to run several promises all in the same time and you want to
ignore rejection unless all of them rejects and you're intersted in only one of them to resolve

## WeakRef

in other languages like C or C++ you'd have to manage memory manually but in JavaScript that happens automatically it allocates memory when objects are
created and frees it when they are not used anymore (garbage collection). and the use case of it is
sometimes you want to garbage collect an object and frees up the memory, for example, we might wanna have a cache that you want to fillup with large Objects
and you want the garbage collector to clear it up more frequently just in case the cache fillup too much
and here where WeakRef comes in handy let's see an example to understand that even more

<Code
  code={`const weakProductsCache = new WeakRef({})
const bigProductObject = {
  name : "the product name",
  productDescrption: "A really long description for this product"
  // and so many more info
}
// and if you want to access properties in this Object
// we can't just acces theme diredctly 
// we have to use a special method like so
weakProductsCache.deref()["bigProductObjectInfos"] = bigProductObject
console.log(weakProductsCache.deref()) 
// => { bigProductObjectInfos : { name : "the product name", productDescrption: "A really long description for this product"}}
`}
/>

now this is going to remain in the weakProductsCache until the garbage collector
wants to get rid of it that could happen anytime there is no way for us to control
when the garbage collector runs, we can't control when this going to happen. this
feature is the most complicated feature of all the features we've talked about. it
is intended for low-level use cases you probably won't be messing around with it
unless you're working on a library or something that is really complicated. if you
want to know more about it you can check the proposal via this [Link](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-weakrefs).
